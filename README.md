## Python game with Pygame ##
I first initialized the pygame with (pygame.init())
A simple python game with pygame. It has simple features such as:( Player, bullets, Enemies, screen, explosion)
I then did a setup for each and every feature to distinctively identify them.
All activities that are performed in the game goes through a while loop.
